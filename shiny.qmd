## Shiny

The Shiny package provides a flexible, easy to use framework for creating interactive web applications with R. Quarto in turn includes support for embedding Shiny components and applets into documents created with the Knitr engine.

Here's a live example of Shiny interactive components along with a brief explanation of the code required to create them:

::: {.border}
```{=html}
 <iframe id="example1" src="https://gaelen-guzman.shinyapps.io/LipidInteractomicsViewer/" style="border: none; width: 100%; height: 720px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

:::

Shiny makes it very straightforward to create interactive documents using only R. Unlike using JavaScript though, you will need to [deploy](shiny/running.qmd#deployment) documents that use Shiny to a server.
